# Knight's tour
A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square, the tour is closed; otherwise, it is open.
It's a recursive implementation of this problem.
